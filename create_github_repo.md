# Create Your GitHub Repository

Before pushing your code, you need to create the repository on GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in with your username (Aresgod112)
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter the repository name: `PDF-Parser`
4. Add a description: "A Python application that extracts key information from contract PDFs"
5. Make sure "Public" is selected
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

Once you've created the repository, come back here and run the following command to push your code:

```
git push -u origin master
```

This will upload all your code to the GitHub repository.

Note: You may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials. Use your GitHub username and password or a personal access token if you have two-factor authentication enabled.

After pushing, your repository will be available at:
https://github.com/Aresgod112/PDF-Parser
