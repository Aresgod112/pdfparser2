# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository and push your PDF Parser project to it:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter the repository name: `PDF-Parser`
4. Add a description (optional): "A Python application that extracts key information from contract PDFs"
5. Make sure "Public" is selected
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository URL (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PDF-Parser.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

You may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. After pushing, refresh the GitHub page
2. You should see all your files in the repository
3. The README.md will be displayed on the main page

## 4. Share Your Repository

Your repository is now public and can be accessed at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PDF-Parser`

You can share this URL with others to give them access to your PDF Parser application.
